*Building a Modern Computer from first principle*
---

The four projects that construct the computer platform
are built using a simple Hardware Description Language (HDL) and simulated on a
hardware simulator supplied with the book.

Five of the subsequent software projects
(assembler, virtual machine I and II, and compiler I and II) can be written in any
modern programming language. The remaining three projects (low-level program-
ming, high-level programming, and the operating system) are written in the assembly
language and high-level language implemented in previous projects.
