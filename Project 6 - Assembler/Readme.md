HACK platform instruction support two instruction types: A- and C- instruction.
The A-instruction is used to set the A register to a 15-bit value:

The C-instruction is the programming workhorse of the Hack platformâ€”the in-
struction that gets almost everything done. The instruction code is a specification
that answers three questions: (a) what to compute, (b) where to store the computed
value, and (c) what to do next? Along with the A-instruction, these specifications
determine all the possible operations of the computer.
